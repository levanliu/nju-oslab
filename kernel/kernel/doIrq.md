### Assembly Code, Do Interrupt request.

```c
.global irqEmpty
irqEmpty:
	pushl $0 // push dummy error code
	pushl $-1 // push interruption number into kernel
	jmp asmDoIrq

.global irqErrorCode
irqErrorCode:
	pushl $-1 // push interruption number into kernel
	jmp asmDoIrq
```
#### different types of interrupts.
```
irqEmpty, 0,-1
irqErrorCode, -1
irqSyscall, 0,0x80
irq_yield,  0,0x81
asmDoIrq
```

line comment
```c
pushal: Pushes all general-purpose registers onto the kernel stack. This operation saves the processor state before handling the interrupt.

movw %ds, %ax: Moves the value of the data segment register (DS) into the AX register.

pushl %eax: Pushes the contents of the AX register (which now holds the DS value) onto the stack.

movw $KSEL(SEG_KDATA), %ax: Loads the kernel data segment selector into the AX register.

movw %ax, %ds: Sets the DS register to point to the kernel data segment. This is a common practice in operating systems when switching between different privilege levels.

movw %ax, %es: Sets the ES register to also point to the kernel data segment.

pushl $0: Pushes a placeholder for the CR3 register, likely indicating that a value related to memory management will be pushed onto the stack later.

pushl %esp: Pushes the current stack pointer onto the stack. This is treated as a parameter for the subsequent irqHandle function call.

call irqHandle: Calls the irqHandle function to handle the interrupt. The function likely processes the interrupt and may perform tasks specific to the type of interrupt.

movl %eax, %esp: Moves the return value from irqHandle into the stack pointer. This might be used to update the stack pointer after handling the interrupt.

addl $4, %esp: Adjusts the stack pointer by 4 bytes, possibly removing the placeholder value pushed earlier for CR3.

popl %eax: Pops a value off the stack into the EAX register.

movw %ax, %ds: Updates the DS register with the value from AX, possibly restoring it to its previous state.

movw %ax, %es: Updates the ES register with the value from AX, potentially restoring it to its original value.

popal: Restores all general-purpose registers with their values before the interrupt handling.

addl $4, %esp (twice): Adjusts the stack pointer twice by 4 bytes each time. This likely removes the interrupt number and error code pushed onto the stack earlier.

iret: Executes an interrupt return instruction, which will pop flags, CS (Code Segment), and IP (Instruction Pointer) from the stack to resume execution at the point where the interrupt occurred.
